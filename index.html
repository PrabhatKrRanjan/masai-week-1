                Samurai Jack is an American action-adventure animated television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network.
                 It follows "Jack", an unnamed[a 1] Japanese samurai who, after nearly defeating the ultimate evil being known as Aku,
                 using a magic katana capable of cutting through virtually anything, is sent forward in time by him to a dystopian future
                ruled by the tyrannical shape-shifting demon. Jack, who is brought to the future with only his robe, sandals, and the sword, 
                quests to travel back to his own time and defeat Aku before he can take over the world. Jack's search for a way back to his 
                own time period transcends Aku's control, but Jack's efforts are largely in vain due to the ways back to his home being just 
                out of his reach.
